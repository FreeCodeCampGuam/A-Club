##### Welcome! In this exercise you will be making a game at the same time learning about the basics of programming. What are you waiting for? Let's get to it!

* **Introduction**  
    To start making your game, you need to access the game editor.
    You need to press <kbd>Esc</kbd> twice (<kbd>Esc</kbd>, <kbd>Esc</kbd>)  
    
    Once you are in the editor, you should see in the very first line: 
    ```lua
    --I am a comment
    ```

    They are called comments. Computers don't read those, it's there to give notes to other programmers.  

    In most video games, code is separated into three parts.  
    Let's start with the first one, `__init` this is where you set up stuff. Other parts of the code are ran over and over, they are what you call **Game Loops.**  

    Let's talk about that later, first we need to start the game but there's something preventing us to do just that.

    > **_Tips:_** to run your game, use the keyboard shortcut <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd>
