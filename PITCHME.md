### Introduction


To start making your game, you need to access the game editor. To do this, press **Esc** twice.

You should see this at the top  of your screen:

At the top you should see the line: 
```lua
	-- i am a comment
```

These are called comments. Computers don't read those, they're there as notes for the programmer

In most video games, code has three parts. Let's start with the first one: |
```lua
    function __init()

    end
``` 
- This is where you put settings for when the game starts for the first time. It only runs | **one time at the beginning of the game.** 

- The other two parts don't just run once, they run over and over again like a loop! They make up what's called the | **Game Loop.**
